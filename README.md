This repository needs to be cloned to the folder ~/.config/
It contains all the config files in my system. After clone the repository,
running the script make_dotfiles.sh will create all the dotfiles need by
the software I am using.
When editing config files in this folder, their corresponding dotfiles 
don't need to be updated, except in the case of profile, which should be
updated by running the make_dotfiles.sh script.
